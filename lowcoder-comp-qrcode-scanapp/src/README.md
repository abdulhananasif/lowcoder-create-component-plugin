## Limitations

On iOS-Devices **with iOS < 14.3** camera access works only in native Safari and not in other Browsers (Chrome,...) or Apps that use an UIWebView or WKWebView. This is not a restriction of this library but of the limited WebRTC support by Apple. The behavior might change in iOS 11.3 (Apr 2018?, not tested) as stated [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_11_1.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014305-CH14-SW1)

> iOS 14.3 (released in december 2020) now supports WebRTC in 3rd party browsers as well ðŸŽ‰ 

### Browser Support

The browser layer is using the [MediaDevices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices) web API which is not supported by older browsers.

_You can use external polyfills like [WebRTC adapter](https://github.com/webrtc/adapter) to increase browser compatibility._

Also, note that the library is using the [`TypedArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) (`Int32Array`, `Uint8ClampedArray`, etc.) which are not available in older browsers (e.g. Android 4 default browser).

_You can use [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) to add support to these browsers._

In the PDF 417 decoder recent addition, the library now makes use of the new `BigInt` type, which [is not supported by all browsers][2] as well. There's no way to polyfill that and ponyfill libraries are **way to big**, but even if PDF 417 decoding relies on `BigInt` the rest of the library shall work ok in browsers that doesn't support it.

_There's no polyfills for `BigInt` in the way it's coded in here._
